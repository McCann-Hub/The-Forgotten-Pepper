# About Me

Hello, Love.

My name is Mrs. Mhm. I am a wife, mother, and among other things, Human. I love singing and dancing while I cook. You can mostly find me listening to the oldies. In my down time, I like playing phone games and binging shows like Handmaid’s Tale, Good Trouble, and first responder shows (as well as CSI- Las vegas).

From showing me how to cut vegetables, giving me secrets to his recipes, and showing me what a love for food looks like, some of my most favorite cooking moments are those I spent in the kitchen with my Father. My favorite smell in his kitchen todate is the smell of Onions, green peppers, potatoes, and sausage sauteeing in the cast iron skillet.

Me. I gain inspiration trying to find different ways to prepare ingredients that I know I need to use soon, and ingredients I haven’t tried before. The challenge, I think, is what gets me excited. I mostly enjoy finding out how flavors blend together. I get really excited when something comes together and I applaud myself with, “Damn! This is so good!

Oh, that reminds me. While I have you, please be warned, I’m going to be myself. Which could mean, nice, sweet, sass, sarcasm, witt, comedic, or weird. Or all of the above, we really just don’t know.

I hope you come back for more recipes geared towards feeding your family while using ingredients you might have forgotten to use right away, or new ingredients you’ve been figuring out how to prepare.
<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting, Love
<br />
<br />
I hope you find something you enjoy!
<br />
<br />
Love always,
<br />
Mrs. Mhm
