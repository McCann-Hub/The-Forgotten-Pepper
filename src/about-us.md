# About Me
![About Me](~@assets/about-me.jpg#float-left#w-1/3)
Hello, Love.

My name is Mrs. Mhm. I am a wife, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, etc. I love singing and dancing while I cook. You can mostly find me listening to the oldies. In my down time, I like playing phone games and binging shows like Handmaid’s Tale and Good Trouble.

My most favorite moments are those I spent in the kitchen with my Father. He taught me how to cut vegetables, gave me secrets to his recipes, and he showed me what a love for food looks like. Watching him cook and move through the kitchen was/is mesmerizing. My favorite smell in his kitchen todate is the smell of Onions, green peppers, potatoes, and sausage sauteeing in the cast iron skillet.

My Mother cooked as well. She had recipes we rarely strayed from. But, helping her cook Thanksgiving dinners and chopping vegetables for her canned tomato soup was always a fun time. 

Me. I gain inspiration trying to find different ways to prepare ingredients that I know I need to use soon, and ingredients I haven’t tried before. The challenge, I think, is what gets me excited. We have our go tos like My mother did, but I mostly enjoy finding out how flavors blend together.

And while I have you, please be warned, I’m going to be myself. Which could mean, nice, sweet, sass, sarcasm, witt, comedic, weird, and a lot of F#$&ing expletives- maybe.

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you find something you enjoy

Love always,

Mrs. Mhm
