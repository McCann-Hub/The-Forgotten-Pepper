# Deconstructed Chicken Dumpling Casserole
Hello, Love!

Sometimes, I have a smorgasbord of different items collecting dust on my shelves because, let’s face it, I am craving something different. And, sometimes nothing sounds good, or both. Or, what I want, I am not even close to having. Have you ever been there? 

I really wanted Chicken and Dumplings and a pot pie. But, let me tell you, I didn’t have any knowledge on how to make dumplings and I do not bake well. So, neither was going to happen because I was not willing to make any crusts. I still wanted chicken and dumplings and a pot pie, though. 

So, I went to the pantry and browsed. More like, scrounged. The light bulb came on…not in the pantry...

I went to work, preparing the casserole. Let’s get started.

Start with the Knorr rice sides. Begin to cook it according to the package using 1tbsp of the stick of butter. While the rice is cooking, dice your chicken and begin cooking in a skillet or frying pan on medium heat. 

Add your seasonings, except for the ranch seasoning, and mix into the chicken. Go ahead and preheat the oven for the biscuits. The rice should be ready to start the simmer step. Add your drained corn or veggies to the rice and complete the simmer step.

Once the oven is preheated, cook your biscuits according to the package.

With the rest of the stick of butter, melt it in the microwave. Make sure you have a microwave safe container. after melting, whisk in the milk, chicken bouillon, and ranch dressing. It should thicken to a gravy consistency. I almost forgot the milk when I made it and was wondering why the consistency was off! 

Once your biscuits are out of the oven, let them cool for a minute. **Do not turn off your oven.** Carefully, cut the biscuits in half. Lay the halves, face up, in a 9 x 13 inch baking pan until the bottom of the pan is covered. Cover with the rice and vegetable mixture. Then layer the cooked chicken on top of the rice. Cover with ¾ cup of the cheese and all of the sauce. Use the remaining cheese and sprinkle on top. 
Place in the oven and cook for 15 minutes.

Love, it is sooo good. The textures and flavors blend well. It tastes like I am in a warm, cozy house surrounded by love and laughter. Or, at least that’s what I imagine it tastes like…  But, I believe this casserole will definitely be one your family thanks you for. Let me know if you try it out!

Thank you for stopping by, Love
