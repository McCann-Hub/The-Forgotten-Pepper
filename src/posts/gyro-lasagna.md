# Gyro Lasagna
Hello, Love.

You know, pasta seems to be a staple. Or is it just grains in general? I don’t even know. 
Anyway, Lasagna. It’s… okay (to me anyway). I know there are plenty of people who love Lasagna. It has amazing ingredients stacked between layers of pasta. I mean, really… who wouldn’t love Lasagna?

Me. I don’t. But, I only don’t like the texture of the ricotta or cottage cheese. The flavors however, from the Lasagnas I have tried, are pretty satisfying.

So, getting to the point. Gyro Lasagna.

It’s full of perfectly seasoned meat, cheese, and more cheese. STACKED!! When you take a bite, it is the perfect mouthful in perfect proportions. It’s ooey gooey goodness.

Love, let me tell you. It is AMAZING. Well, that is just my opinion.

So let’s get into it. Turn that oven on. It needs to be at 350 degrees. Hopefully, your beef is thawed. If not, do that now, as well. I like to set mine out in the morning. I think thawing it that way lets the meat absorb all the water again and when it cooks, it takes the seasoning better. Get out your pot and boil some water. Use that to cook the Lasagna noodles. (If you buy pre softened noodles or make them yourself, skip boiling them).

Get out your Green pepper, onion, and garlic. Dice the green pepper and mince garlic and onion. I recommend starting with the green pepper and then the garlic since the onion is going to excrete that lovely chemical that makes you want to cry. Just let it, I like a good cry. And then I blame it on the onion.

Once those are chopped you can set them aside and begin browning your beef. (You can begin doing this when you turn the oven on). Add your diced, minced ingredients and stir in. 
Once the meat starts to sweat, glisten, add your seasonings and stir in. 

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the Greek Yogurt, Parmesan cheese sauce, and dill. Set aside. Rinse your cutting board and knife and slice the tomatoes in quarters (or dice 
if using romas).

Alrighty, get out your 9 x 13 inch baking pan or casserole pan. Layer a thin layer of your sauce on the bottom of your pan with a spatula. If your noodles are done, lay out one layer of noodles atop the sauce. Your beef should also be browned at this point. Layer your meat down, add another layer of sauce and then shredded cheese. Add a layer of noodles and begin again.
Keep layering until you run out of ingredients. I am usually able to get 3 layers. Top with your quartered (or diced) tomatoes. (Add more cheese, you know you want to.) Cover with aluminum foil and place in the oven for 25 minutes.

Now, this serves 6-8 depending on how you cut it when it comes out of the oven. I cut it to feed 6, but those are bigger servings. (and I go up for seconds, who am I kidding?)
You got there! This should only take approximately 45 minutes to cook. WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS! -fyi. Sorry for screaming... I love when the two year old wants to help but runs from me with a kitchen utensil.

Let me go catch ‘em

Thank you for stopping by, Love.
