# One Pot Tuna Casserole
Hello Love,

It’s been a busy week. It’s been great, though. I have had the week off, so I’m reconnecting with the things and people that I love. It’s really therapeutic to sit back and count your blessings.

Even when my busy week goes well, I still sometimes head for convenience. I have to remember I can cook something in the time it takes to order food or go to the drive thru.

My two year old loves helping Mom in the kitchen. So, I let him pour the noodles into the pot. And then, he takes off with kitchen utensils and a cookie sheet and pretends to make “Mac cheese”. 
While he is preoccupied, I get busy cooking dinner.

Love, let me tell you. This Tuna Casserole is Filling, Cheesy, and has a bright satisfying flavor. The dill and lemon pepper are great companions. It’s extremely simple, too!!
This Tuna casserole could also be served at a potluck or dinner party! 
Are you ready for simple without sacrificing flavor?

Begin by boiling a pot of water and add your dash of salt. Grab your box of elbow macaroni and cook them according to the package. Once cooked, drain the noodles. Return them to the pot. Add all your other ingredients and cook for an additional 3 minutes or until heated through. Serve.

That’s it, Super simple and quick! I hope you enjoy it.

Thank you for stopping by, Love.
