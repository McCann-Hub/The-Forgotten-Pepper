# Philly Cheesesteak Casserole
Hello, Love.

Have you ever tried a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich? The steak and peppers sitting atop a nice toasted sub bun and smothered in provolone cheese. You take one bite, first hearing the crack of the toasted bun, and then being met with a flavorful bite. The textures are all balanced and so harmonious you are now in a blissful state. 

This recipe does not mimic that. You get to experience first hand what I come up with when thinking about how to use something that is in its’ last day. For me, that is usually green pepper. 

Anyway, on with it. So, I know I need to use this poor green pepper, but what sounds good? I usually go through a plethora of different ideas until I stumble upon one. I won’t bore you with the complete thought process.

So here we are, this simply amazing dish for the whole family. (Or myself, I really think I ate most of it.) Made with ground beef, peppers, and cheeses, it tasted just like a philly cheese steak sandwich, except for the toasted bun. And, we enjoyed it in front of America’s favorite sport, gymnastics… JK!! Hahaha.

So how do we make this?

Love, start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees and thawing your ground beef if you have not done so already. Put on a pot of water adding salt and bring to a boil. Dice both of your peppers first and then your onion. You want to save yourself from a good cry? Try holding a spoon on your tongue while chopping. Otherwise, have a good cry. After you wipe your eyes, Begin browning your ground beef adding your peppers and onion. Once those start to sweat, add your seasonings and stir. 

Add your noodles to your boiling water. Follow the instructions on the box. No, I don’t have time to make my own pasta, and I am not ashamed! I would love to someday. Once your noodles are done boiling, drain. In a 9 x 13 pan, mix together your meat and noodles until evenly distributed.

Now here comes the fun part. Add ½ your shredded cheese into the pan and mix into the other ingredients. Watching cheese melt, move and stretch is so satisfying. Do you love watching cheese melt? Once you are done admiring the cheese move between noodles and meat, go ahead and flatten down and top with the remaining cheese.

Bake for 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Cut into 6 or 8 pieces and serve. 

But stop again as you move the slice from the pan to the plate and watch the cheese stretch! Oh, so amazing. 

If you try this out, let me know how it goes for you!

Thank you for stopping by, Love.
