# Spicy Lady Glaze
Hello, Love

I hope you are having the most sassiest, fantabulous day. I am. I am really feeling snarky today. I got out of bed ready to roar. My two year old is hanging out with his Dad, today. Probably watching television. And me, well… it’s probably for the best I’m talking to you rather than pretending I care about watching music videos or Bumblebee, for the millionth time. It’s something similar to the Frozen phenomenon I keep hearing about… the one where it’s all the child wants to watch...There is always tomorrow to watch it, again.

So as you can see, I’m really feeling the sass today. Luckily, I also have the mind to cook something scrumptious. My child decided this week that he was not into strawberries, so alas, I have to do something with them. I’m thinking this jam will do the trick.

I like it HOT. Not the weather- I do like warmer weather, but… ugh back on track. 
Jalapeno and serrano are not as spicy as I can handle it. But, it does satisfy my need for heat.
Do you like it hot? Add some sweet spice to your life with this spicy strawberry jam.

If you are ready to brave the heat...Grab a medium saucepan. Wash all your strawberries and peppers. Cut the strawberries in half and slice the peppers for easier cooking. I recommend washing your hands immediately. You may forget you touched hot peppers and touch something else...not cool. Put the Strawberries and Peppers into your saucepan along with a ¼ cup of sugar. Cook those beauties on low to medium heat. Go ahead and stomp out some of your sass while you mush the ingredients. Your nose might also get a good cleaning… Mashing allows the fruit and pepper’s natural sugars and flavors to blend and saturate each other. When your mixture becomes easy to mash and is mostly liquid, remove the pan from the heat. Let it cool. 

When it’s safe, go ahead and add it to your food processor, blender, or use an immersion blender with the mixture in a mixing bowl. Blend the mixture until mostly smooth (or completely, it’s your preference. I like a little pulp in mine). When you are done blending it to the desired consistency, place it back in the pan and bring to a boil. At boiling, add your pectin and remaining ¼ cup of sugar. Bring it to a boil again. After allowing to boil for 1 minute, remove the mixture from the heat and place in jars. The jam will begin to set. Refrigerate. I’ve kept mine in the freezer for about 6 months now, and it is still as delicious as ever.

This is your warning. The spice does not dull down. However, the strawberry is a great companion for the peppers. I love it and It is good with peanut butter. However, I prefer it by itself.
Tips: You can take the seeds out of the peppers to make the jam a little milder. You can also strain the fruit after blending to make it more smooth.
Let me know if you try this and how it goes for you!

Thanks for stopping by, Love.
